                      <p>Ramanaya is considered to be one of the old, valued scriptures that reflects the Indian culture. It also reflects the ideal way of lifestyle, Lord Rama and Goddess Sita being the epitome of perfection.</p>
                      <p>Ramayana is not limited to a particular religion. It is a gift to the mankind. Anyone following any belief on this planet can read this story and become more human. But remember this advice of my Guru who says "Never imagine Rama as God while reading Ramayana. It ruins the spirit of Ramayana because Rama never declared himself as God. He, as an ordinary human being, showed how to face the problems of life without leaving Dharma."</p>
                      <p>Having heard many stories and incidents from Ramayana, now is the time to incorporate those life lessons to be more peaceful and happy.</p>

                      <h3>Always keep good company</h3>
                      <p>It is said that your company shapes you into a person you are. We have been told to keep good company since childhood and Ramayana too emphasize the relevance of good company. Queen Kaikeyi, the third wife of Dashratha loved Rama more than her own son but her handmaiden, Manthara poisoned her thoughts with negative feed, in result Kaikeyi asked for Rama’s fourteen years of exile. A negative person can brainwash all the good inside you, that is why we should always keep a healthy circle so that we become better with time.</p>

                      <p>Lord Rama treated everyone equally and that’s how he earned the love and respect among everyone. No matter if a person was younger or elder, poor or rich, he was the same person for everyone. Even when Sabari (the sage’s daughter) offered him the already tasted berry fruits he ate them without giving a second thought. He was always kind and humble to people. We should toe inhere this quality. We should always treat everyone with equality and should not discriminate on the basis of status, sex, age, or cast. We should treat animals equally as the true human being is the one who knows that everyone deserves an equal treatment.</p>

Actually, it wasn’t a deer, but Mareech, Ravana’s accomplice in disguise of the animal.When the brothers were out pursuing the deer, Ravana arrived, abducted Sita, placed her in his flying chariot, and flew through the skies to Lanka. When the princes, after having killed the golden deer and discovered it was a demon in disguise, returned to their hut, they found it empty and started to look for Sita.</p>

                      <h3>Truth triumps</h3>
                      <p>The basic teaching of Ramayana is that no matter how powerful the evil is, it will always be defeated by Good. Truth always wins, no matter how vicious or poisonous lie is because even a bitter truth oozes with positivity and the sweetest lie has the darkest agenda behind it. The win of good over evil is a universal fate. A person should always have a noble heart and good values. That is how Lord Rama defeated the most knowledgeable person in history, Ravana.</p>
