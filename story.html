    <meta name="description" content="Ramayana is not limited to a particular religion. It is a gift to the mankind. Anyone following any belief on this planet can read this story and become more human. But remember this advice of my Guru who says never imagine Rama as God while reading Ramayana. It ruins the spirit of Ramayana because Rama never showed himself as God. He, as an ordinary human being, showed how to face the problems of life without leaving Dharma.">

                      <h2>Ramayana</h2>
                       <br/>
                       <p>॥१॥ शुक्लाम्बरधरं विष्णुं शशिवर्णं चतुर्भुजम्।</p>
                       <p>       प्रसन्नवदनं ध्यायेत् सर्वविघ्नोपशान्तये ॥१॥</p>
                       <p>(The One Who is adorned with a white garment, Who is All-Pervading, Who is bright as a full moon, Who has four arms, and Who has a pleasant smiling face, may be meditated upon to extinguish all obstacles.)</p>
                        <p>॥२॥ आपदामपहर्तारं दातारं सर्वसम्पदाम्। </p>
                        <p>    लोकाभिरामं श्रीरामं भूयो-भूयो नामाम्यहम् ॥२॥</p>
                        <p>(This is a salutation offered at the start of reading any scripture as per tradition. This prayer is for removing all obstacles encountered. The prefix Sri to Rama indicates that Rama is always accompanied by Sri, his consort Seetha in the form of goddess Sri Maha Lakshmi.)</p>
                        
                    </div>
                    <p>Ramayana is considered as the oldest epic in world literature with its 24,000 verses. It is a treasure house of knowledge and an inexhaustible mine for later poets and has a special place in Indian culture as well as Sanskrit literature. It is translated into all Indian languages and to several European languages along with English. It is also rendered with variations in many South and South-east countries since several centuries and they have adopted the epic in their music, dance, ballet, art and architecture.</p>
                    <p>Ramayana was composed in Sanskrit by the sage Valmiki, who taught it to Rama's sons, the twins Lava and Kush. At about 24000 verses, it is a rather long poem and, by tradition, is known as the Adi Kavya (adi = original, first; kavya = poem). While the basic story is about palace politics and battles with demon tribes, the narrative is interspersed with philosophy, ethics, and notes on duty. While in that other Indian epic, the Mahabharata, the characters are presented with all their human follies and failings, the Ramayana leans more towards an ideal state of things: Rama is the ideal son and king, Sita the ideal wife, Hanuman the ideal devotee, Lakshman and Bharat the ideal brothers, and even Ravana, the demon villian, is not entirely despicable.</p>
                    <h2>Rama is born</h2>
                    <p>Dasharath, king of Ayodhya, had no children. So he arranged a Putra-kameshti sacrifice (putra = son, kameshti = that which is desired). At the sacrifice, Agni (god of fire) arose from the flames and handed the king a golden vase brimming with nectar. "Give this to your queens", said the god and disappeared. The king had three wives. To the eldest, the king gave half of the nectar; the second queen got a portion that remained when the queen had drunk her half. To the youngest queen, the king gave the remaining half of the nectar and again, the second queen got the portion that remained. In time, the queens gave birth to sons: to the eldest was born Rama, to the youngest was born Bharat, and to the second queen were born the twins Lakshman and Shatrughna.</p>
                    <h2>Rama marries Sita</h2>
                    <p>When the princes had grown up some, the sage Vishwamitra arrived at Dasharath's court and asked that Rama and Lakshman be "lent" to him to help him rid his hermitage of the demons that were plaguing the ashram dwellers by defiling their sacrifices with blood and bones, and by killing them off. After the two princes successfully rid the ashram of the demons, the sage took them to the neighbouring kingdom of Mithila to show them the swayamvar festivities of the Mithila princess, Sita, born of the earth. The king of that country had adopted Sita as his daughter and, after Sita had grown up, had declared that he would give her in marriage to anyone who could string the Great Bow of Shiva.</p>
                    <p>Vishwamitra brought the two princes of Ayodhya to Mithila where the swayamvar was declared. No one could string the Shiva’s bow. Several kings, princes, and commoners had tried and failed. It was the time when Vishwamitra asked Rama to go and do it. Rama walked over, picked up the bow, strung it, and plucked the bowstring with such a twang that two things happened simultaneously: the twang was heard for miles around, and the force of it broke the bow into two with so great a sound that all the people in the hall fainted except the king, the sage, the princess and the princes. Then Rama was married to Sita. His three brothers were married to a sister and cousins of Sita, and there were many festivities and much rejoicing in the two kingdoms.</p>
                    <h2>Rama is exiled</h2>
                    <p>Some time later, Dasharath decided he had grown too old to rule and declared he would abdicate in favour of Rama, the eldest born and the crown prince. This is when his youngest queen invoked an old promise that Dasharath had made to her: she demanded that Rama be exiled for 14 years and that her own son, Bharat, be crowned king. Dasharath refused but Rama decided to honour his father's old promise and left for the forests. He was accompanied by Sita and by Lakshman, both of whom could not be dissuaded from following him. In grief at the injustice of it all and at Rama's departure, Dasharath died within two days.</p>
                    <p>Bharat was not in Ayodhya when these events happened; he, and the fourth prince Shatrughna, were away holidaying at Bharat's maternal grandfather's country. They were summoned to Ayodhya in haste and, when Bharat learnt what had happened, he was furious. He shouted at his mother, refused to ascend the throne, and gathered the townsfolk around him to proceed to the forest and bring Rama back.</p>
                    <p>Rama refused to return, stating his intention to serve his father's last wish by being an exile for the full 14 years. Bharat returned with Rama's sandals, placed them on the throne, and proceeded to rule the country in Rama's name. Meanwhile, Rama moved further south even deeper into the forests so that the people of Ayodhya would not find it easy to keep coming to his hut and begging him to return.</p>
                    <h2>Ravana abducts Sita</h2>
                    <p>One day, a demoness named Surpanakha saw Rama and, being charmed out of her wits by his beauty, walked up to him and begged him to marry her. "I already have a wife", said Rama and pointed to Sita. "Why don't you marry my brother Lakshman instead?" When Surpanakha turned towards Lakshman, he declared he'd taken a temporary vow of celibacy and sent her back to Rama. What followed was that the brothers took turns to thus play ping-pong with her and when Surpanakha, by now angry beyond measure, rushed towards Sita to kill her, Lakshmana cut off Surpanakha's nose and ears.</p>
                    <p>Surpanakha flew towards Lanka (modern Sri Lanka), ruled by her brother Ravana, and complained. Enraged, Ravana vowed vengeance. He persuaded the demon Marich to disguise himself as a golden deer and wander near Rama's hut. When Sita saw the golden deer, she begged Rama to get it for her. When the brothers were out pursuing the deer, Ravana arrived, abducted Sita, placed her in his flying chariot, and flew through the skies to Lanka. When the princes, after having killed the golden deer and discovered it was a demon in disguise, returned to their hut, they found it empty and started to look for Sita.</p>
                    <h2>Rama meets Hanuman</h2>
                    <p>During their wanderings, the princes came upon a group of monkeys who showed them some ornaments of Sita's: the monkeys had seen a beautiful lady crying and dropping her ornaments from a chariot in the sky that was being driven southwards by a demon.</p>
                    <p>Among the monkeys was Hanuman, who ultimately located Sita's whereabouts to be in Ravana's kingdom in Lanka. Rama gained the help of the monkey chief Sugreeva, gathered a monkey army, marched southwards, built a bridge across the ocean and crossed over to Lanka. Rama, after an epic battle, was then able to kill Ravana and finally free Sita.</p>
                    <h2>Sita faces a trial by fire</h2>
                    <p>When Sita walked up to Rama, however, he refused to accept her since she had been a living in a demon's palace all this while. Hurt, Sita entered into a burning pyre intending to give up her life. However, Agni rose from the flames, carrying an unhurt Sita in his arms and said:</p>
                    <p class="sloka">एषा ते राम वैदेही पापमस्यां न विद्यते</p>
                    <p class="sloka">(Here, Rama, is your Sita. She has not an iota of sin in her.)</p>
                    <p>This event came to be known as the Agni Pareeksha (agni = fire, pareeksha = test).</p>
                    <h2>Rama is crowned at Ayodhya</h2>
                    <p>Since the 14 years were over by then, Rama returned to Ayodhya, was crowned king, and ruled the kingdom with great wisdom. The kingdom was called as "Ramarajyam" where no child died before their parents did, no door needed locks against robbers, no farmland lay barren, no tree went fruitless, and there was peace and prosperity all around.</p>
